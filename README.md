## Convert VB6 to VB5 every time a project loads\! \*\*Zipped Version for people that had problems\*\*


</div>

### Description

This program converts the VB6 project file to VB5, before opening VB to open the file. If the file is already VB5 compatible it will leave it alone. Compile the file to the same folder where Vb5.exe is and then hold down SHIFT while right clicking on a .vbp file. Choose Open with... then click on other and choose the file that you compiled. Now whenever you open a .vbp file it will convert it then allow VB to open it. NOTE: if there are more tags that are not VB5 compatible, please tell me. The old version did not work with project files that had a space in the path, but this version is compatible. If you like this app, please rate it.
